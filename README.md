# Angular 5 Labs
Labs for the Angular5 Courses

## Getting started
1. [Setup](#setup)
1. [Lab instructions](#lab-instructions)
1. [To run a solution](#to-run-a-solution)
1. [About the warehouse](#about-the-warehouse)
1. [RESTful APIs](#restful-apis)
1. [Instructor notes](#instructor-notes)

## Setup
There are only four things needed for setup and to run the labs:
1. bash
1. node ^6.7 with npm
1. The Angular cli (ng) ^1.3
1. mongoDB ^3.2

If you want some installation help including verification steps, go [here](setup/Angular%20Class%20Setup.pdf) .

## Lab instructions

Each lab's instructions are located in the [instructions](instructions) folder. 

## To run a solution
Each lab can be run without copying any files. Just open a bash shell, cd to the lab solution folder and type in 
```
npm install
npm start
```
If you want to use a solution from a prior lab as a starter, either copy the whole folder to a new one or simply begin editing the code in that folder.

# About the warehouse
We have products, locations, orders, and customers. They are stored in collections (aka tables) in a mongo database.

## Orders
Have a status:

Status | Meaning
-------|-----------
0      | Ready to pick, pack, and ship
1      | Shipped
2      | Has problem(s) that a supervisor should fix

## Locations
LocationID is a string with this format: AASHB where ...
* AA- Aisle - 01-99
* S - Slot - A-Z
* H - Shelf - 1-9
* B - Bin - A-Z

For example, 
01A1A = Aisle 1, Slot A, Shelf 1, Bin A

Only one product will be stored in a location so locationID is a primary key
